**DeepDive** helps teams collect, analyze, and act on large-scale online conversation data. It processes unstructured data from social media, communities, and review platforms, turning it into structured insights through NLP, signal analysis, and automated workflows.

DeepDive is designed to integrate seamlessly with external tools and data systems. Through APIs and integrations, teams can enhance their workflows with real-time social signals, including brand mentions, sentiment, intent, emerging topics, and risk indicators.

## What DeepDive Provides

DeepDive enables users to:

- Monitor conversations across multiple platforms and sources
- Analyze sentiment, topics, narratives, and intent at scale
- Detect early signals, anomalies, and potential risks
- Export structured intelligence into downstream tools for activation

## Using DeepDive with Integrations

DeepDive supports integrations that enable social intelligence to flow seamlessly into operational systems, including CRMs, enrichment tools, analytics platforms, and automation pipelines.

In this documentation, you'll find:

- How DeepDive data is structured and exposed
- Step-by-step guides for integrating DeepDive with external tools and platforms
- Examples for syncing signals, alerts, and enriched attributes into external workflows

This documentation focuses on **how to connect, configure, and use DeepDive data programmatically**, rather than on product features or marketing use cases.
